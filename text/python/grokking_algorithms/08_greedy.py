# -= vs |= vs .add
# ChatGPT
# Certainly! In Python, -=, |=, and .add() are used for different purposes when working with sets.

# -=: This operator is used to perform the set difference operation. In your code, states_needed -= states_covered is removing the states covered by the current station from the set of remaining states needed.

# |=: This operator is used for the set union operation. In the modified code, cumulative_states_covered |= states_covered is updating the cumulative set of states covered by adding the states covered by the current station.

# .add(): This method is used to add an element to a set. In your original code, final_stations.add(best_station) is adding the current best station to the set of final selected stations.

# To summarize:

# -=: Set difference, removing elements from a set.
# |=: Set union, adding elements to a set.
# .add(): Adding a single element to a set.
# In the context of your problem, -= is used to update the set of remaining states needed, |= is used to accumulate the set of states covered by all selected stations, and .add() is used to add the best station to the set of final selected stations.
